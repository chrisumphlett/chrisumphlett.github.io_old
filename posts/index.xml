      <description>For many years I used a web site called Shelfari to track my reading and wish list. This was eventually swallowed by Amazon and merged with Goodreads. For reasons I cannot remember now I did not like Goodreads and ended up switching to a service called LibraryThing that created a conversion process to get the Shelfari data in there. I haven’t used it as faithfully as Shelfari and only recently started marking dates when I completed books.</description>

      <description>Project OverviewThis data set contains data on fictitious undergraduate students. It includes demographic information, performance and outcomes. I used R to analyze and visualize what is significantly correlated with, and potentially predictive of, undergraduate outcomes of gpa and staying in school (“Persistence”).
There were many questions I would have asked if I could have spoken to someone who knew the data. For example, did high school GPA always exist on a six point scale?</description>

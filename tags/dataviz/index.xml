      <description>While I’d love to minimize the distinction made in business according to the idiosyncracies of the calendar, I believe it’s here to stay. We analysts have been spoiled by base 10. It is a bit of an annoyance to have time intervals that don’t fit neatly: 7 days make a week, but 4.23 weeks make a month? There are 12 months in a year but 365.25 days? Beyond that, why do we compare 28 day periods versus 31 day periods (Jan to Feb to March)?</description>

      <title>revulyticsR: Connect To Your Revulytics Data With R!</title>

      <description>I have just finished the first development version of a new R package, revulyticsR. It facilitates making a connection to the Revulytics API and executing various queries. You can use it to get active users (daily, monthly, etc) and (eventually) to query on various advanced events and get the results in tidy data frames.
Revulytics is a provider of usage analytics and in-product messaging software. My company, TechSmith, utilizes it in our desktop products.</description>

      <title>My first R package: openEndedAnalyzeR</title>

      <description>Recently I created my first R package and deployed it to GitHub. I developed it as part of my work at Consumers Energy, working with survey data frequently to help improve customer experience. Below is the vignette that I have created to document the basic usage of the package.
You can visit the site repo and get installation instructions here.
openEndedAnalyzeR enables fast, pre-packaged analysis of qualitative survey responses (“open-ended” or “verbatims”).</description>

      <description>Lately I’ve been doing a lot of text mining at work, analyzing the relationship between various qualitative responses on customer surveys to the quantitative responses. On a given survey we may have several qualitative responses and I’m also working towards developing a generalized exploratory text and sentiment analysis that we can use to better determine what should be manually reviewed by business SME’s.
In that vein I combined some of what I’ve been learning doing that with an analysis of customer reviews.</description>

      <title>Accuweather forecast accuracy part 1: Hourly Precipitation probability</title>
      <link>/posts/accuweather-forecast-accuracy-part-1-precipitation-probability/</link>

      <description>Previously I wrote about how to get weather data from the Accuweather API with R. Now I will begin doing a series of analyses of the forecasts and the forecast accuracy, starting with the hourly forecast for precipitation probability. In addition to having fun with the data I hope to learn some things that may help me better utilize consumer weather forecasts in the future.
The data I’ve collected includes forecasts for 1 to 12 hours in advance and the actual observations on an hourly and daily basis.</description>

      <description>As a kid I spent a lot of time on road trips playing travel bingo. Recently I found some cards at a toy store while traveling with my own children and they enjoyed using them as well. I wanted the cards to work better for my kids, especially my three-year-old who can’t see that well out the window, so I decided to create my own before our next road trip a few weeks later.</description>

      <title>Automatic Feature Selection with R &amp; CART</title>

      <description>For a recent work project I had a statistical problem I had not dealt with before: multi-class classification. We have a system that can classify about 75% of phone calls, and I needed to classify the remainder into one of five types. The data also had what to me were many features (~300) and I wanted a way to dynamically select features as this classification would be performed weekly but the call data could change significantly from week-to-week and over time.</description>

      <title>Collecting data from the Accuweather API</title>

      <description>I began collecting hourly and daily forecast and actual weather data from the Accuweather API in May 2019. The endgame will be to do analysis to discover the points at which the forecast accuracy degrades (eg, an hourly forecast gets significantly worse at 4 hours away; a daily forecast gets worse at 3 days away).
I have learned quite a bit about weather forecasting without studying it directly– it is discussed in depth in both Nate Silver’s book The Signal and the Noise and Michael Lewis’ (Audible only) book The Coming Storm.</description>

      <description>For Women&amp;rsquo;s History Month 2019 my first-grade daughter and I did a project together to celebrate the musical artists featured in Vashti Harrison&amp;rsquo;s books Little Leaders and Little Dreamers. We created a flipbook with the xaringan package for R and RStudio.
Here is a link to the flipbook.</description>

      <description>For years I used an Excel workbook with VBA to track our vehicles’ preventive maintenance and notify me when something was needed. This process hasn’t worked well the last couple years as the laptop with MS Office and the scheduled task is rarely left on when it is scheduled to run. I had also failed to account properly for some maintenace tasks that had never been done, but I intended to do, within a few years after purchasing the vehicles.</description>

      <title>Dynamic resume&#39;s built in R with the vitae package</title>

      <description>Updated Sept 25, 2019
A couple of months ago I came across the vitae package which was recently developed by Mitchell O’Hara Wild. I have been using the same basic resume template for over 10 years, mainly by default, but I really liked the layout offered by one of the vitae templates and the ability to build it with R Markdown turned a chore into something fun to do (keeping the resume current).</description>

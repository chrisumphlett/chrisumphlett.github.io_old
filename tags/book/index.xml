      <description>I am reading Matt Perman&amp;rsquo;s How to Get Unstuck and taking on the writing exercise at the end of each chapter. More information in this article on the introduction.
Chapter 1 describes what Perman says are the three ways we get stuck: 1. We don&amp;rsquo;t know what God wants us to do 2. We know but we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to make it happen 3. Obstacles prevent us from doing it.</description>

      <description>I just began reading Matt Perman&amp;rsquo;s How To Get Unstuck: Breaking Free From Barriers To Your Productivity. I was pleasantly surprised by a section he added to the end of each chapter&amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;The Unstuck Clinic&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash; which summarizes the chapter, has an application exercise for the reader and provides resources for further reading.
 Too often my zeal for wanting to read more becomes an obstacle to reading well. Even when I started this book a few days ago, part of the time reading the introduction was also while serving as a jungle gym for a four-year-old.</description>

      <description>I am reading Matt Perman&amp;rsquo;s How to Get Unstuck and taking on the writing exercise at the end of each chapter. More information in this article on the introduction.
Chapters 9-10 are about being a professional and the importance of preparation. These were two of my favorite chapters so far as each expressed very well some things that I have thought before. It gave me language and organized processes that will help me to do some things that I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past, but better and more focused and with more consistency.</description>

Part 2 of the book is on Personal Leadership, Perman&amp;rsquo;s all-encompassing term for what we need to do in order to get and stay unstuck. It is what is required in order to take the personal effectiveness of chapters 4-6 and direct it appropriately.</description>

Chapters 4 - 6 all discuss what Perman calls &amp;ldquo;Personal Effectiveness&amp;rdquo;. It is more than just time management:
 personal effectiveness is the skill of leading yourself every day to get the right things done in the right way, for the right reason, and in the shortest possible amount of time.</description>

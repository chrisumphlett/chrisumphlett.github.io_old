      <description>For a recent work project I had a statistical problem I had not dealt with before: multi-class classification. We have a system that can classify about 75% of phone calls, and I needed to classify the remainder into one of five types. The data also had what to me were many features (~300) and I wanted a way to dynamically select features as this classification would be performed weekly but the call data could change significantly from week-to-week and over time.</description>

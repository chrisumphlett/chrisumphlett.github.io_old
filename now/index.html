<p>Listed below are categories that show what I&rsquo;m spending most of my time doing. Ultimately, I am attempting to align these with my current vision for my career: To live in the intersection of data science and behavioral economics/decision science&ndash; to be a data-driven decision scientist.</p>

<h2 id="current-projects-work-consumers-energy">Current projects (Work @ Consumers Energy)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Modeling customer experience during power outages as a function of the characteristics of the outage, weather, customers&rsquo; recent experience with outages, notifications sent to customer, and estimated restoration time. I am using various ML techniques to identify significant features, and regression models to quantify the impact.</li>
<li>Creating a generalized text mining analysis that can be used to analyze any free responses from customer survey data.</li>
<li>Tuning our speech analytics tool to better transcribe and categorize call recordings.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="current-projects-personal">Current projects (Personal)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Working pro bono with our local children&rsquo;s museum to provide analytical support to better organize and then get insights from their member data. Currently most of my time is facilitating a partnership between the museum and Michigan State University&rsquo;s Master of Business Analytics students as their final semester project.</li>
<li>Learning how to do river fishing in Michigan which is much different from the fishing I did growing up in North Carolina. I had a goal to catch one salmon in 2019. I caught two. Now we are moving on to trying to target and catch steelhead and/or northern pike.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="things-i-d-like-to-work-on">Things I&rsquo;d like to work on</h2>

<ul>
<li>My family recently became licensed for foster-care. We are planning to participate in a transitional foster care program for unaccompanied minors arriving at the US-Mexico border. It was supposed to have already started and we&rsquo;ve been preserving margin in our time and energy in anticipation of that.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="skill-development">Skill Development</h2>

<ul>
<li>I need to switch from <code>gather</code> and <code>spread</code> from the <code>tidyr</code> package to either the new <code>tidyr</code> functions for pivoting data or the <code>data.table</code> functions. But I&rsquo;d just recently really developed a mastery of gather/spread!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<h3 id="finished-recently-and-still-thinking-about">Finished recently and still thinking about</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>To Sell is Human</em> by Dan Pink</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="currently-reading-listening-or-revisiting">Currently reading, listening or revisiting</h3>

<h3 id="starting-soon">Starting soon</h3>

<ul>
<li><em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> - Daniel Kahneman</li>
<li><em>Half the Sky</em> - Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>

<p>This web site is primarily to function as an extension of my professional life. At any given time, my life in Lansing, Michigan as a husband, father to four young children and homeowner provides many challenges, goals and failures.</p>

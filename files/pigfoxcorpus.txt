I am fox
I am pig
I am little
I am big
I have some socks
I like to play
I think I will trick Pig today
this pair of socks was on my feet
this pair of socks does not smell sweet
I fill it with the stink socks
I have a pretty little box
and hide inside this handy pail
to watch pig find his stink mail
a little box what can this be
oh can it be a gift for me
what is inside i cannot tell
i lift the lid what is that smell
the only thing inside this box is one old pair of stink socks
these socks do not go in my mail
they go inside my laundry pail
now who would give me smelly socks
that really stink
and so does fox
he is fox
he is pig
he is little
he is big
oh i am such a sneaky fox
i have another pair of socks
another pair of socks that stink
another funny trick i think
i have pig bowl
i have pig slop
socks on bottom
slop on top
i put pig favorite spoon inside
now i must find a place to hide
here comes pig i must be quick
this empty can should do the trick
yum yum i cannot wait to eat
a bowl of slop oh what a treat
but wait what is inside my slop
that sneaky fox he has to stop
that sneaky fox he is so bad
that sneaky fox he makes me mad
i would not ever want to eat the socks from fox stink feet
uh-oh
my slop was ruined by those socks
that really stink
and so does fox
i am fox
i am pig
i am little
i am big
i had my fun i had my laugh
now i will go and have a bath

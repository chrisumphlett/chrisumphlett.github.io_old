      <description>For many years I used a web site called Shelfari to track my reading and wish list. This was eventually swallowed by Amazon and merged with Goodreads. For reasons I cannot remember now I did not like Goodreads and ended up switching to a service called LibraryThing that created a conversion process to get the Shelfari data in there. I haven’t used it as faithfully as Shelfari and only recently started marking dates when I completed books.</description>

      <description>Project OverviewThis data set contains data on fictitious undergraduate students. It includes demographic information, performance and outcomes. I used R to analyze and visualize what is significantly correlated with, and potentially predictive of, undergraduate outcomes of gpa and staying in school (“Persistence”).
There were many questions I would have asked if I could have spoken to someone who knew the data. For example, did high school GPA always exist on a six point scale?</description>

      <description>When I began my career in the analytics space in 2011 it seemed important to me to gain specific, specialized knowledge in certain areas. I had previously been a &amp;ldquo;jack-of-all-trades, master of none&amp;rdquo; kind of guy and that was not where I wanted to be professionally. Business analytics became that area of focus but after eight years I know now that once you gain a certain competency in data analytics you realize that they are innumerable subdomains; I am now, once again, somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades.</description>

      <description>I have just finished the first development version of a new R package, revulyticsR. It facilitates making a connection to the Revulytics API and executing various queries. You can use it to get active users (daily, monthly, etc) and (eventually) to query on various advanced events and get the results in tidy data frames.
Revulytics is a provider of usage analytics and in-product messaging software. My company, TechSmith, utilizes it in our desktop products.</description>

      <description>For the last few months I have been working on turning some previous work into an R package marketr. I needed to learn a quite a bit to develop it as a working package posted to GitHub; and in turn, do even more to get it on to CRAN. Once you understand the end product there are a lot of things I could have done differently in the development to help next time.</description>

      <description>Recently I created my first R package and deployed it to GitHub. I developed it as part of my work at Consumers Energy, working with survey data frequently to help improve customer experience. Below is the vignette that I have created to document the basic usage of the package.
You can visit the site repo and get installation instructions here.
openEndedAnalyzeR enables fast, pre-packaged analysis of qualitative survey responses (“open-ended” or “verbatims”).</description>

      <description>Lately I’ve been doing a lot of text mining at work, analyzing the relationship between various qualitative responses on customer surveys to the quantitative responses. On a given survey we may have several qualitative responses and I’m also working towards developing a generalized exploratory text and sentiment analysis that we can use to better determine what should be manually reviewed by business SME’s.
In that vein I combined some of what I’ve been learning doing that with an analysis of customer reviews.</description>

      <description>Previously I wrote about how to get weather data from the Accuweather API with R. Now I will begin doing a series of analyses of the forecasts and the forecast accuracy, starting with the hourly forecast for precipitation probability. In addition to having fun with the data I hope to learn some things that may help me better utilize consumer weather forecasts in the future.
The data I’ve collected includes forecasts for 1 to 12 hours in advance and the actual observations on an hourly and daily basis.</description>

      <description>As a kid I spent a lot of time on road trips playing travel bingo. Recently I found some cards at a toy store while traveling with my own children and they enjoyed using them as well. I wanted the cards to work better for my kids, especially my three-year-old who can’t see that well out the window, so I decided to create my own before our next road trip a few weeks later.</description>

      <description>For a recent work project I had a statistical problem I had not dealt with before: multi-class classification. We have a system that can classify about 75% of phone calls, and I needed to classify the remainder into one of five types. The data also had what to me were many features (~300) and I wanted a way to dynamically select features as this classification would be performed weekly but the call data could change significantly from week-to-week and over time.</description>

      <description>I began collecting hourly and daily forecast and actual weather data from the Accuweather API in May 2019. The endgame will be to do analysis to discover the points at which the forecast accuracy degrades (eg, an hourly forecast gets significantly worse at 4 hours away; a daily forecast gets worse at 3 days away).
I have learned quite a bit about weather forecasting without studying it directly– it is discussed in depth in both Nate Silver’s book The Signal and the Noise and Michael Lewis’ (Audible only) book The Coming Storm.</description>

      <description>library(tidyverse)library(timetk)The purpose of this post is to demonstrate a new visual that I developed in my day job at Consumers Energy. I cannot share that data or visual and decided to use some of R’s built in data sets to show the visual. The scenario is spurious, but that is besides the point.
I thought it would be fun to look for some kind of spurious relationship between a causal factor and annual “Important Discoveries” from the discoveries data set (according to the The World Almanac and Book of Facts in 1975).</description>

      <description>I am reading Matt Perman&amp;rsquo;s How to Get Unstuck and taking on the writing exercise at the end of each chapter. More information in this article on the introduction.
The final part of the book includes six short chapters, each focused on a specific &amp;ldquo;laser&amp;rdquo; used to overcome certain types of obstacles. Below are some that I found interesting.
Adaptive Time Management Adaptive time management builds on the assumptions that &amp;ldquo;many tasks overflow their boundaries, and unexpected things come up.</description>

      <description>I am reading Matt Perman&amp;rsquo;s How to Get Unstuck and taking on the writing exercise at the end of each chapter. More information in this article on the introduction.
This part of the book was interesting to read but more familiar to me as I am already familiar with and have implemented much of what Perman discussed. It served as a good reminder because the last few months have been a time where I have not practiced personal management as much as I would like.</description>

      <description>I am reading Matt Perman&amp;rsquo;s How to Get Unstuck and taking on the writing exercise at the end of each chapter. More information in this article on the introduction.
Chapters 9-10 are about being a professional and the importance of preparation. These were two of my favorite chapters so far as each expressed very well some things that I have thought before. It gave me language and organized processes that will help me to do some things that I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past, but better and more focused and with more consistency.</description>

      <description>For years I used an Excel workbook with VBA to track our vehicles’ preventive maintenance and notify me when something was needed. This process hasn’t worked well the last couple years as the laptop with MS Office and the scheduled task is rarely left on when it is scheduled to run. I had also failed to account properly for some maintenace tasks that had never been done, but I intended to do, within a few years after purchasing the vehicles.</description>

Part 2 of the book is on Personal Leadership, Perman&amp;rsquo;s all-encompassing term for what we need to do in order to get and stay unstuck. It is what is required in order to take the personal effectiveness of chapters 4-6 and direct it appropriately.</description>

      <description>Updated Sept 25, 2019
A couple of months ago I came across the vitae package which was recently developed by Mitchell O’Hara Wild. I have been using the same basic resume template for over 10 years, mainly by default, but I really liked the layout offered by one of the vitae templates and the ability to build it with R Markdown turned a chore into something fun to do (keeping the resume current).</description>

Chapters 4 - 6 all discuss what Perman calls &amp;ldquo;Personal Effectiveness&amp;rdquo;. It is more than just time management:
 personal effectiveness is the skill of leading yourself every day to get the right things done in the right way, for the right reason, and in the shortest possible amount of time.</description>

      <description>While I’d love to minimize the distinction made in business according to the idiosyncracies of the calendar, I believe it’s here to stay. We analysts have been spoiled by base 10. It is a bit of an annoyance to have time intervals that don’t fit neatly: 7 days make a week, but 4.23 weeks make a month? There are 12 months in a year but 365.25 days? Beyond that, why do we compare 28 day periods versus 31 day periods (Jan to Feb to March)?</description>

Chapters 2 and 3 describe what being unstuck looks like.
Chapter 2Perman defines being unstuck as &amp;gt; Getting important work done through obstacles, and to keep doing it over and over again.
If you are unstuck you will be using these skills: Clarity, Discipline, Focus, Energy, Speed, Estimation, Completion and Love for others.</description>

Chapter 1 describes what Perman says are the three ways we get stuck: 1. We don&amp;rsquo;t know what God wants us to do 2. We know but we don&amp;rsquo;t know how to make it happen 3. Obstacles prevent us from doing it.</description>

      <description>I just began reading Matt Perman&amp;rsquo;s How To Get Unstuck: Breaking Free From Barriers To Your Productivity. I was pleasantly surprised by a section he added to the end of each chapter&amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;The Unstuck Clinic&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash; which summarizes the chapter, has an application exercise for the reader and provides resources for further reading.
 Too often my zeal for wanting to read more becomes an obstacle to reading well. Even when I started this book a few days ago, part of the time reading the introduction was also while serving as a jungle gym for a four-year-old.</description>

      <description>Last year I taught a data science lesson to my daughter’s kindergarten class. I learned that they already practice data science: in the morning they would observe the weather, record it on the computer, and then look at a visualization of the weather so far in the month. Amazing! I was able to share with them how that same process (observe/collect data, clean data, analyze data, and visualize data) is what I do at work.</description>

      <description>Project OverviewThis data set contains data on fictitious undergraduate students. It includes demographic information, performance and outcomes. I used R to analyze and visualize what is significantly correlated with, and potentially predictive of, undergraduate outcomes of gpa and staying in school (“Persistence”).
There were many questions I would have asked if I could have spoken to someone who knew the data. For example, did high school GPA always exist on a six point scale?</description>

      <description>For many years I used a web site called Shelfari to track my reading and wish list. This was eventually swallowed by Amazon and merged with Goodreads. For reasons I cannot remember now I did not like Goodreads and ended up switching to a service called LibraryThing that created a conversion process to get the Shelfari data in there. I haven’t used it as faithfully as Shelfari and only recently started marking dates when I completed books.</description>
